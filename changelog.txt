v4

-Upgraded to Python 3
-Added support for BNW v2.1 (14b)
-Fixed some minor bugs

v3

-Enemy level randomization is severely dampened
-Fixed a bug that caused drop data to be copied from steal data
-Shop wares are now a fully random selection based on overall item distribution, rather than a gentle mutation
-Elemental affinities on equipment are no longer randomized
-Decreased the value of money chests
-Added some optional patches for BNW

Fanatix changes:
	-The same NPC (inn/save/etc) will never appear two floors in a row (excepting colosseums)
	-Duplicate shops will not appear
	-Shop progression is more linear
	-Tents and sleeping bags no longer appear
	-Overall a much lower average TTFFD (Time To First Fenix Down)
	-Start with 2 Fenix Downs. I figure if Arvis can send you off with 2 sleeping bags, it's the least I can do.
	-Party members are auto-optimized when they become available (not in BNW)
	-Enemy progression is a little smarter
	-Inns/save points are a little cheaper
	-MP is now displayed in the menu from the start
	-Ultros 1 won't appear
	-Some very glitchy, game-crashing maps were removed from the pool
	-Maps where the music gets restarted on load should be gone completely now
